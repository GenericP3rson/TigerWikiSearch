A modified Pagerank is run and the resulting vertices, scores, and text content are uploaded to a Bleve indexâ€”in this repo, [`wiki_graph.bleve`](wiki_graph.bleve). The document mapping and uploading the Pagerank results in this repo is [graph_to_bleve.go](graph_to_bleve.go). A search can then be run with Blevesearch and both the Pagerank and TF-IDF scores are considered in the final ranking and results.

The final product uses a Gin Gonic server ([main.go](main.go)) and an HTML page designed with Bootstrap ([index.html](index.html)) to communicate the search results with the frontend.
